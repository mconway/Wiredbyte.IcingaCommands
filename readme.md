# Icinga2 Post to Slack Notification script

This is a quick script I wrote to post Icinga notifications from my home network to Slack. I know there are slack bots that integrate with Nagios already. This was an experiment into the world of Python for me. I'd love to hear any feedback about the script and tips on writing better Python!

TODO:
- Create a setup guide (this readme file)
- Set Env variable for slack channel
- Maybe get rid of the Env variable method and use comman dline arguments
- Post screenshots
- Add a requirements.txt file
